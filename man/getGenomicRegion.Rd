\title{Obtain the chromosome and coordiates of the currently displayed genomic region.}
\usage{
\S4method{getGenomicRegion}{igvR}(obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An object of class igvR}
}
\value{
A list with four fields: chrom (character), start(numeric), end(numeric), string(character)
}
\description{
Some caution is needed with this function when called right after a lengthy
browser operation - of which the main example is display a GenomicAlignmentTrack.  igv.js
does not at present allow us to delay the return from javascript pending completion of the
track rendering.  This does not pose much of a problem when you manipulate igv in the browser
from R in normal interactive mode:  simply wait for your last command to complete.  But
if you are running in programmatic mode, as we do when testing igvR, then caution is advised.
See the test_displayAlignment function in unitTests/test_igvR.R.
